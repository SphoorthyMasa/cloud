Cloud infrastructure Assignment

Question 1

Using the pseudo-algorithm described in the slides. 1). Write a program to implement the Maekawa’s algorithm. The inputs are N- the number of nodes and K- the size of each subset and the output is a list of subsets that have pare-wised non-null intersection. Test different combination of N and K to see if your program can always generate the correct subsets. 2).Create N processes and use quorum-based algorithm with Maekawa voting sets to achieve distributed mutual exclusion. You can use any programming language. 3). Discuss the possibility of deadlock in the implementation.  (Reference: “A sqrt(N) Algorithm for Mutual Exclusion in Decentralized Systems”, available at http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=214445.)
Note: 
The results (indicating the events from processes) should be printed out by the algorithm.
